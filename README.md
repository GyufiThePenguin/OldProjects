# Old Projects and Practice Exercises

Welcome to my collection of old projects and practice exercises! 
These are some of the coding challenges, experiments, and small projects I've worked on in the past. While they may not represent my current skills, they just serve as a record.
Mostly C# projects just dumped in a folder from my Primary and High School days.
